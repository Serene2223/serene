          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p> <strong>Campaign </strong> </p> <p>Our brand was established with the main goal of giving moms sense of relaxation from their everyday responsibilities. The brand's concept is focused on encouraging balance, care, awareness, and empowerment, all of which are essential elements of a satisfying and sustainable being. We want to empower moms to live their lives with more intention and purpose by putting these principles first. This will ultimately lead to more happiness and fulfilment. Every element of our brand, from our product offerings to our message and overall brand identity, reflects our dedication to these beliefs. Our campaign connects to our objectives because we are creating not only a brand but also a community where mothers feel heard and are taken care of, making them feel more empowered. </p>
		
		<p> <strong>Objectives</strong></p>
		<p><u>Affective Objectives:</u> We want them to feel heard, care, relaxed and confident. </p>
		<p><u>Response Objective:</u> We want them to check out our platforms, like our content and leave comments under it (15 likes per post and 5 comments)</p> 
<p><u> Reach Objective:</u> 500 views on our Facebook post and 650 views on our Instagram post by 10th of April 2023 <p><strong>Promotional activities</strong></p>  <p>We created and posted content introducing our brand and its values, funny content that mothers can relate to, Facts about mothers and reels about tips and tricks mothers can use and about the services we provide. The channels we chose to promote our brand on are Instagram and Facebook. We chose these two platforms based of the consumer insights we gathered from our interviews and research we found that these are the most used platforms by mothers.  </p>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During this campaign project we had many learning moments, especially when it came to posting on our social media platforms. We evaluated that we reached more engagement and interaction on our Instagram compared to our Facebook, however, we still did not reach our objectives. Our reach objectives were to reach 500 views on our Facebook and 650 views on our Instagram by the 10th of April. When analyzing our insights on both social media platforms we realized that we did not reach our objective goals. We were only able to reach 324 accounts on Instagram and 43 accounts on Facebook. Even though we did not reach our objectives, we did learn more about how to navigate these platforms to get the most engagement. We realized reels perform better on Instagram than other normal posts and also that using hashtags on our posts increases engagement.  

 </p>
		<p>Our Facebook page did not receive the engagement we expected. We only have 4 likes on our Facebook page and barely receive any interactions on our posts. We still have to figure out how to reach the Facebook target audience effectively by maybe tailoring our content for Facebook instead of using the same content we use on Instagram on Facebook.  </p>
		
		<p>In the beginning we also did not follow our content planner strictly and our content ideas were not very detailed, after meeting with the team, we made our planner more detailed and made sure we followed it strictly.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>We have only recently started posting content on our social media platform to promote our Brand Serene. On our Facebook and Instagram pages, we have shared many memes, stories, reels, and images. If the current project persists, we intend to adhere to our pre-planned schedule of posting while potentially modifying our content posting strategy, such as alternating the days for posting reels and regular posts. Additionally, we plan to commence live streaming sessions once we have garnered 500 followers on Instagram and 300 followers on Facebook. This approach will enable us to showcase and communicate information about our brand and services while also fostering more direct interaction with our audience. We will create a social media for Days that are special or meant for mothers/women which will highlight our special deals and packages for spa services and products. We will offer discounts on certain treatments, create gift baskets, or even host a giveaway to encourage our audience to use our services. We will encourage our customers to share their experiences and results on social media, using our hashtags. We will also do some personal interviews to show credibility and reliability as people connect more when they look at real reviews. Collaborations with Influencers is also something which we believe is useful in increasing brand credibility. We will partner with social media influencers who target moms and have a following in our local area. Ask them to share their experience at your spa, and in exchange, offer them a free treatment or a discount on services. To keep your target audience interested in our services and engaged on social media, we will host frequent discounts and promotions. 
		  All these are ideas we believe will be effective in raising brand awareness and exceeding our objectives. </p>
       
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          
          <p>We connected our Facebook and Instagram together, so every post that was posted on Instagram was immediately posted on Facebook as well. We first started off by posting our Logo with a “coming soon” text to start raising brand awareness. In our second post we gave a definition of our brands name Serene. We later then introduced our brand values in a carousel post where we also explained what these brand values mean to us. In our fourth post we decided to post a meme to make our target audience feel more connected with each other. We also posted a reel in which introduced our services to give our target audience a better perspective of our brand and what we offer. Our sixth post was a post that included facts about mothers and motherhood to give out knowledge and raise awareness. We also posted another meme about stressed out moms, again just to make things feel more fun and relatable for our target audience. Our next post was a reel where we offered tips and ways moms can relax and where we invited them to book a spa day with us at Serene. Our most recent most was a post to make moms feel heard and cared for where we made a reminder about how taking care of themselves is also important.</p>

            <li>Serene is a Spa that offers childcare services to mothers when they book an appointment with us. We have services varying from massages, facials, mani and pedi’s, quality time activities for mothers and their children and childcare services such as babysitting. With our babysitting services, mothers can finally have quality time for themselves while also having a luxurious self-care experience at Serene without having to worry about their child. </li>
            <li>We also have a service we call “Mommy &amp; Me”, where mothers can spend quality time with their children by doing fun activities such as arts &amp; crafts, an outdoor play area and DIY projects where the mother and child can make their own self care products such as soaps and creams.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>When we choose our target audience which was “Parents with young children”, we explored on topics and issues that parents may face when it comes to parenting young children. We decided to actually narrow down our target audience and make it more specific by focusing on Mothers aged 25-45 with young children aged 0-10. After our first round of interviews, we found that most of the mothers in this target group lack time for themselves and their selfcare and that they also wish that their some type of extra support for mothers. They also lack sleep and even when they do get some time for themselves, they are too tired to actually do something for themselves or to actually relax. The first idea we came up with was a monthly subscription-based self-care baskets where mothers get personalized selfcare items at the foot of their doorstep. We then realized that even though this basket can save mothers some time because it’s delivered at their doorstep and they don’t have to go out and buy the products, it still does not solve the solution, which is mothers not really having time for themselves, cause the children will probably still be around their mom while she is trying to do some selfcare and enjoy herself. We then came up with the idea of a Spa that offers childcare services. This way mothers can truly have quality time for themselves by receiving spa treatments and not have to worry about their children because they are being taken care of by certified and trusted professionals. Existing alternatives could be the usual Spa’s and babysitting services. We are also aware that Ikea also offers a supervised childcare service so parents can leave their child there and enjoy the shopping experience on their own. After concluding our consumer insights about mothers in this age group of 25-45, we decided to use the social media platforms Instagram and Facebook since the mothers expressed that they use these platforms the most either for themselves and to also look up stuff for their children.
