		<p class="bodyfont">Name: Anne van Dijk <br>
Age: 37 <br>
Status: Married <br>
Children: 2 young children <br>
Occupation: Primary school teacher <br>
			<br>

Anne and her husband, Frank van Dijk have been married for ten years. Anne has always dreamed of starting a family and she is now the proud mother of her 6-year-old son Levi and her 3-year-old daughter Lotte. They all live together in a city apartment due to both of the parent´s jobs. 
</p>
		<p class="bodyfont"> Daily life: Besides having the dream of a family, Anne also became a full time primary school teacher. Even though this is her dream job and it is very important to her, it is very demanding as she must work outside of her regular working hours to prepare the lessons, talk to parents or have work meetings. When she comes home after her work, she has to juggle household chores like cooking and cleaning, parenting, and extracurricular activities for her children as her husband still works until the kids are almost going to sleep. </p>
		<p class="bodyfont">Challenges: Her daily routine is very tiring and drains her of energy so that by the very end of the day, she cannot spend much time nor effort into her own marriage and relationship with Frank, or any quality time to look after herself and meet her own needs because the kids are her very first priority. This leaves her feeling frustrated and drained of energy as well as neglected. 
After a long day, she scrolls a bit on her phone trying to catch up a bit on the outside life by scrolling through Instagram and Facebook, organizing things that have to be done for the next day, and texting with her family and friends. As her days are long and energetic, she falls asleep quickly but cannot get enough and sufficient restful sleep as she cannot switch off properly and has to get up early again the next morning to use the time of getting up to spend time with her children.
</p> <p class="bodyfont">Needs and wants: Anne wants to prioritize her own self-care and relaxation to recharge and avoid burnout. She wants to be able to prioritize herself without feeling guilty, while still providing for her family and maintaining a loving household.</p>
